There are a few potential bugs in the provided code:

1. In the `bot()` function, the condition for opening a new position has an incorrect variable name. Instead of comparing `size` with `pos_size`, it should be comparing `open_size` (which is calculated as `pos_size / 2`) with `pos_size`.

   ```python
   if not open_positions and open_size < pos_size:
   ```

2. The code is missing a line to create a symbol-specific order book for each iteration of the `for symbol in symbols` loop in the `bot()` function. You can add the line `order_book = fetch_order_book(symbol)` just before the line `ask_price, bid_price = ask_bid(order_book)`.

   ```python
   for symbol in symbols:
       order_book = fetch_order_book(symbol)
       ask_price, bid_price = ask_bid(order_book)
       # rest of the code...
   ```

3. The `size` variable in the `bot()` function is not defined. To fix this, you can assign it the value of `position['size']` inside the `for position in open_positions` loop.

   ```python
   for position in open_positions:
       size = float(position['size'])
       # rest of the code...
   ```

4. The `is_volume_under_decimal()` function is checking the volume ratio in reverse. It should be checking if the volume ratio is greater than the threshold, not less than. You can modify the return statement to `return volume_ratio > threshold`.

   ```python
   # Check if the current volume is under the specified decimal threshold
   def is_volume_under_decimal(order_book, threshold):
       bids = order_book['bids']
       asks = order_book['asks']
       total_bid_volume = sum(bid[1] for bid in bids)
       total_ask_volume = sum(ask[1] for ask in asks)
       volume_ratio = total_ask_volume / total_bid_volume
       return volume_ratio > threshold
   ```

5. The `should_exit_position()` function is not correctly comparing the percentage to the target and max_loss variables. The condition should be `pnl_percentage >= target` for exit and `pnl_percentage <= max_loss` for stop loss.

   ```python
   # Check if it's time to exit the position based on the profit and loss percentage
   def should_exit_position(pnl_percentage, target, max_loss):
       if pnl_percentage >= target or pnl_percentage <= max_loss:
           return True
       return False
   ```

Please note that the above suggestions assume that the functionality of the code aligns with your desired outcome, and there may be other improvements that could be made as well.
